## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome! I'm Julio Reyes.

About me:

My attraction to the tech world stems from my experience in quality control and assurance.

I am currently learning software testing fundamentals and automated testing with Python.

I understand the guarantee and confidence that quality provides for products, and that's why I seek to contribute to any organization that gives me the opportunity, by providing rigorous testing.
